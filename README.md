# Game Review Application using PERN stack

How PERN stack is used:

Postgres - Storing list of games and reviews into Postgres Database.

Express - Web framework for node.js.

React.js - Running on the front-end, sending requests to the API to receive data from database.

Node.js - Allows running of Javascript server side.

# Getting Started

cd review

npm start
```
